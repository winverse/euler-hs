# Why Haskell?
  The Haskell has a several features. 
  For example Lazy evaluation, Type guard, Pattern matching, etc...   
  but What I want to learn the most is Type System (it is called Type checking) in Haskell  
  The Type System is, i think, the most important thing in modern programming language,   
  [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) what seems to have been influenced by haskell, is also has a powerful type system. also [Yi KwangKeun](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~kwang/) professor at Seoul National university(SNU), insisted type system as the reason why we need to learn nML.

# The Path
 I like studying FP, Haskell has always been a language i like to learn.  
 Haskell is really not easy for me, But I try... and again try...  
 This repository a process of The trying...
